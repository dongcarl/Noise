# Noise

Swift implementation of the Noise Protocol Framework (revision 34 of the spec).

Compatible with macOS 10.15 or above. CryptoKit is used where possible.

At the time of writing, the codebase only contains a toy implementation of `IKpsk2_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`.

Please don't use this for anything. Like, at all.
